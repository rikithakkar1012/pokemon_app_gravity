# Pok√©mon Card App

A Flutter app that allows users to browse, search, and view detailed information about Pok√©mon cards using the [Pok√©mon TCG API](https://api.pokemontcg.io). The app features pagination, search functionality, detailed card views with smooth animations, and efficient image caching.

## Features

- **Pok√©mon Card List and Search:**
  - Display a paginated list of Pok√©mon cards fetched from the Pok√©mon TCG API.
  - Search Pok√©mon cards by set name.
  - Infinite scroll with dynamic loading of new cards.

- **Card Detail Page:**
  - View detailed information about a selected Pok√©mon card, including attacks, weaknesses, artist, and more.
  - Smooth transition between the card list and detail page using Hero animation.

- **App Navigation:**
  - Manage routes with custom animations to provide a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **API Integration:** 
  - Pok√©mon TCG API (https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/cards) for fetching Pok√©mon card data.
  - Pagination and search queries based on set name (`q=set.name`).
  
- **Image Caching:** 
  - `cached_network_image` for efficient image caching to reduce network usage.

- **State Management:** 
  - `GetX` for state management and handling reactivity in the app.

- **HTTP Requests:** 
  - `Dio` for making reliable HTTP requests.

- **Animations:** 
  - Twin animations with the `Hero` widget for smooth transitions between the card list and detail page.

- **Dependency Injection:** 
  - `GetIt` for dependency management.

## Code Structure

- **PokemonController:** 
  - Handles fetching Pok√©mon card data, search functionality, and pagination.
  
- **PokemonCardWidget:** 
  - Displays each Pok√©mon card in a grid with its image and name.
  
- **PokemonDetailPage:** 
  - Shows detailed information of the selected Pok√©mon card.

## Assumptions

- **Pagination:** 
  - Assumes the Pok√©mon TCG API supports pagination, allowing for fetching large data sets efficiently.
  
- **Search Functionality:** 
  - Based on querying the Pok√©mon card's set name (`set.name`). Future improvements could extend the search functionality.

- **Image Caching:** 
  - Assumes the Pok√©mon TCG API provides valid image URLs that are cached using `cached_network_image`.

- **Network Connectivity:** 
  - Requires an active internet connection for fetching data from the API.

- **Error Handling:** 
  - Displays a generic error message if the API request fails, with room for advanced error handling in the future.

- **Smooth Transitions:** 
  - Uses a simple `Hero` animation for smooth transitions between screens, with potential for more complex animations.
